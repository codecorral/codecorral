## Context

The CodeCorral HM module (`programs.codecorral`) currently handles per-project claude-code delegation and agent-deck `config_dir` convention (from fix-project-config). Schema distribution lives in a separate `programs.openspec` module. There's no mechanism to declaratively provision agent-deck session layouts.

Shuffle (`codecorral/shuffle`) is a Go CLI that applies deck YAML files to agent-deck idempotently via `shuffle deal`. All prerequisites are done (issues #1-4 closed): `--profile` flag, Nix packaging, error handling, file path resolution.

This change consolidates the HM module into a single `programs.codecorral` namespace and adds automatic deck provisioning.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Migrate `programs.openspec` into `programs.codecorral.schemas` with backwards-compatible deprecation
- Remove premature per-project `openspec` options from the project type
- Author the 6-group AI-DLC deck YAML with conductor definitions
- Add shuffle as a flake input and bundle the deck as a Nix derivation
- Add HM activation script that runs `shuffle deal` per project automatically

**Non-Goals:**
- User-configurable deck options — the layout is fixed, CodeCorral applies it behind the scenes
- Per-project deck customization — all projects get the same 6-group layout
- Variable substitution or templating in deck YAML
- Deletion/cleanup semantics for removed sessions (shuffle is additive-only)
- Changes to shuffle CLI itself (all prerequisites done)

## Decisions

### D1: Schema migration with `mkRenamedOptionModule`

Move schema distribution from `programs.openspec` to `programs.codecorral.schemas`:

```nix
# Before (separate module):
programs.openspec.enable = true;
programs.openspec.schemas = [ "dev.codecorral.intent@2026-03-11.0" ];

# After (unified):
programs.codecorral.enable = true;
programs.codecorral.schemas = [ "dev.codecorral.intent@2026-03-11.0" ];
```

Implementation: fold the `nix/hm-module.nix` logic (schema selection, `xdg.dataFile` generation) into `nix/codecorral-hm-module.nix`. Add `mkRenamedOptionModule` so `programs.openspec.schemas` forwards to `programs.codecorral.schemas` with a deprecation warning. The `homeManagerModules.openspec` flake export becomes an alias.

The `schemaPackage` option moves too — it needs access to the flake's `self` for the default value. The module function signature changes from `{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:` to receiving `flake:` as a curried argument (matching the existing `hm-module.nix` pattern).

### D2: Remove per-project openspec from project type

The current `projectType` has an `openspec` submodule with `schemas` and `schemas_path`. These are premature — schemas are global, not per-project. Remove:

- `openspec` option from `projectType` in the HM module
- `allSchemas` union logic
- `openspec.schemas_path` from config.yaml generation
- `openspec_schemas_path` from TypeScript `ProjectConfig` type
- Per-project openspec delegation block

### D3: Deck YAML authoring with overridable conductor policy

Create `decks/codecorral.deck.yaml` defining the standard 6-group AI-DLC session layout. The deck YAML is a **template** — the `claude_md` path for the foreman conductor is resolved at activation time, allowing per-project overrides.

Ship a default conductor policy at `decks/conductors/foreman.md`. This is the fallback — users can override it per-project via the `conductor_policy` option in the project type.

```yaml
name: codecorral
groups:
  clint:
    conductors:
      foreman:
        description: "Primary conductor — polls task board, delegates work"
        claude_md: ./conductors/foreman.md
    sessions: {}
  exploration:
    sessions: {}
  backlogs:
    sessions: {}
  elaboration:
    sessions: {}
  construction:
    sessions: {}
  operations:
    sessions: {}
```

Groups start minimal — sessions are created dynamically by the conductor at runtime. The deck establishes the group structure and the foreman conductor. Empty groups are valid in shuffle.

### D3a: Per-project conductor overrides

Shuffle's `Conductor` type has two file fields: `claude_md` (agent instructions/system prompt) and `policy_md` (approval/routing rules). Both support file paths resolved relative to the deck YAML. Users should be able to override either per-project, per-conductor.

Add `conductors` to the project type:

```nix
programs.codecorral.projects.my-project = {
  path = "...";
  conductors.foreman = {
    claude_md = ./my-foreman-instructions.md;  # null = use default
    policy_md = ./my-foreman-policy.md;        # null = use default
  };
  # Structure supports multiple conductors from the start
};
```

Type: `attrsOf (submodule { claude_md = nullOr path; policy_md = nullOr path; })`, default `{}`.

The activation builds a per-project deck derivation that:
1. Copies the base deck YAML and default conductor files
2. For each conductor override, copies the user's file into the derivation and patches the deck YAML to point at it
3. Shuffle deal runs against the per-project deck

If no conductor overrides are set, the bundled default deck is used directly (no per-project derivation needed).

### D4: Shuffle flake input and deck derivation

Add shuffle to `flake.nix` inputs:

```nix
inputs.shuffle.url = "github:codecorral/shuffle";
```

Bundle the deck YAML and its referenced files as a Nix derivation:

```nix
packages.codecorral-deck = pkgs.runCommand "codecorral-deck" { } ''
  mkdir -p $out
  cp -r ${./decks}/* $out/
'';
```

The HM module references this derivation to get the Nix store path for `shuffle deal`.

### D5: HM activation script

Add a DAG entry to `home.activation` that runs `shuffle deal` for each project:

```nix
home.activation.codecorral-deck = lib.hm.dag.entryAfter [ "writeBoundary" ] ''
  ${lib.optionalString (cfg.projects != { }) ''
    for profile in ${lib.concatStringsSep " " (lib.attrNames cfg.projects)}; do
      $DRY_RUN_CMD ${shuffle}/bin/shuffle deal \
        --profile "$profile" \
        ${deckDerivation}/codecorral.deck.yaml \
        || $VERBOSE_ECHO "warning: shuffle deal failed for profile $profile"
    done
  ''}
'';
```

Key requirements:
- `entryAfter ["writeBoundary"]` — deck files must be in place before shuffle runs
- `$DRY_RUN_CMD` — respects `home-manager switch --dry-run`
- `|| warn` — swallows failures (shuffle or agent-deck not running) to avoid aborting `home-manager switch`
- Only runs if projects are configured

### D6: Unified module function signature

The current `codecorral-hm-module.nix` uses `{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:`. To access the flake's schema package (needed for schema distribution), it needs the flake reference. Follow the existing `hm-module.nix` pattern: the flake exports a curried function `flake: { config, lib, pkgs, ... }:` and the flake passes `self`:

```nix
homeManagerModules.codecorral = import ./nix/codecorral-hm-module.nix self;
```

## Risks / Trade-offs

**[`mkRenamedOptionModule` deprecation noise]** → Users see warnings on every `home-manager switch` until they migrate. Mitigation: warnings are informative and the old options keep working.

**[Shuffle not installed]** → If agent-deck or shuffle isn't on PATH during activation, `shuffle deal` fails. Mitigation: error is swallowed with warning; activation continues.

**[Empty groups in agent-deck]** → Verified OK in shuffle's parser. Agent-deck's `group create` acceptance needs runtime testing. Mitigation: if it fails, shuffle's error handling returns non-zero, which the wrapper catches.

**[Deck YAML in Nix store is immutable]** → Users can't edit the deck layout. Mitigation: this is intentional — the layout is CodeCorral's opinion, not user-configurable.
